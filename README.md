# Crop Yield Prediction with Machine Learning (SDG 2: Zero Hunger)

This project uses **machine learning** to predict crop yields based on environmental and agricultural inputs, directly supporting the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2 â€“ Zero Hunger**. By offering accurate predictions, the tool helps farmers, NGOs, and governments make better decisions about food production and distribution.
